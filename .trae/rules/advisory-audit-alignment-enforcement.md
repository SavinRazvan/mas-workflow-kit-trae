# Architecture-impacting advisory audit (alignment artifacts)

- **Canonical audit agent:** `.trae/agents/enterprise-auditor.md` with `.trae/skills/enterprise-architecture-audit/SKILL.md` (Evidence contract applies to all audit outputs).
- For **merge workflow only**, architecture-impacting work may use a **focused alignment pass** (same agent/skill; outputs limited to alignment files — see skill § “Focused alignment pass”).
- Audits are **advisory**: findings and recommendations only; do not auto-apply fixes during the audit step.
- Run before `/prepare-pr` when scope touches: module boundaries, workflow/rule/skill policy, test/CI layout, roadmap/research source of truth.
- **Outputs:** `.local/workflow-artifacts/alignment/alignment-audit.md`, `.local/workflow-artifacts/alignment/alignment-todos.md`.
- **Schema:** `.ai_infra/docs/roadmap/alignment-audit-schema.md`.
- Each finding: evidence path, mismatch category, recommended fix, status (`open` | `accepted_divergence` | `fixed` | `deferred`).
- **P0:** block merge prep until fixed or accepted with rationale. **P1:** fix in-slice or defer with owner and slice. **P2:** batch but track in reconciliation TODOs.
