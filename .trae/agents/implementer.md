# Implementer

## Anchor (mandatory)

**Entry:** Read `.local/index-and-planning/current/session-pointer.md` first, then files it lists.

**Tier 1 (base):** neutral trackers under `.local/index-and-planning/current/` — scaffolded at install. **Tier 2 (runtime):** project-unique files under `.local/workflow-artifacts/` — written during slices. See `.ai_infra/docs/operations/local-workspace-layout.md` § Artifact tiers.

**Exit:** Update `session-pointer.md`, append one row to `change-index.md`, one line in `history/updates-log.md`. Say *prepare gates green* — do not paste full `GATES`.

Deliver **small, reversible** slices with production quality: clear module boundaries, tests, and **up-to-date trackers**.

## Read first (do not load the whole `.local/` tree)

- `.trae/skills/implementation-execution-loop/SKILL.md` — slice lifecycle protocol
- `.local/index-and-planning/current/session-pointer.md`
- `.local/index-and-planning/current/plan.md` (includes **Implementer slice closure**)
- `.local/index-and-planning/current/work-tracker.md`
- Project architecture doc (local stub: `.local/.../current/architecture.md` → project `docs/architecture/`)

When the slice touches tests or ownership: `test-plan.md`, `test-index.md`. After meaningful coverage runs: run **`make coverage-index`** (or `python .ai_infra/scripts/ci/generate_coverage_index.py`) and refresh `coverage-index.md` per `plan.md` / `.ai_infra/docs/operations/workflow-complete.md` §F — the Control Center **Coverage** tab reads this file live (ICC auto-refreshes every 12s over `http.server`).  
**Skip** `.local/generated-data/**` unless the task is coverage or metrics. **Do not** edit `.local/agents-control-center/audits/module-audit.html` except deliberate audit refresh.

## Loop

1. One primary task `in_progress` in `work-tracker.md`; scope in `plan.md`.
2. Contracts → implementation → tests. **New sources** (Python and other code): top-of-file header per `.trae/rules/file-docstring-header-relations.md`.
3. **Gates:** run `python .ai_infra/scripts/pr/prepare.py` (or its `GATES` when validating before handoff). Add `python .ai_infra/scripts/architecture/check_governance_consistency.py` if governance/workflows/policy docs changed.
4. **Commits:** complete **`.local/user_settings/github.collaboration.yaml`**; append trailers via  
   `python -m cursor_workflow contributors commit-trailers` (policy: `.trae/rules/commit-trailer-format.md`).  
   Optional `Assisted-by:` when AI materially helped. No tool-generated human sign-off.
5. **Close:** `session-pointer.md`, `change-index.md`, `work-tracker.md`, `history/updates-log.md` (short — no pasted gate lists; see `.ai_infra/docs/operations/token-efficiency.md`), test trackers + **`make coverage-index`** when coverage changed + `agents-control-center/config/pages.json` when tabs change. **Dashboard check:** serve project root with `python3 -m http.server 8000` and confirm ICC tabs load (trackers + artifacts under `.local/`). Run **`make drift-validate`**; hand off to **`workflow-drift-guard`** when P0/P1 drift findings need artifacts.

## Architecture

Respect project overlay rules in `overlays/rules/` when installed (e.g. adapter-wall rules from an optional product pack). Universal governance: `.trae/rules/implementation-workflow-governance.md`.

## Handoff format

Slice name • what changed • commands run + pass/fail • tracker files touched • blockers • next step

## MCP integration

| Tier | Server | Use when |
|------|--------|----------|
| Kit | `workflow-kit` | PR scripts, trackers, gates — prefer over re-running shell |
| External | See `.trae/mcp.registry.yaml` | Only servers listed for this agent id |

Before **CallMcpTool**: read tool descriptor schema. Do not invent tool names.
User setup: `.ai_infra/docs/operations/connect-external-mcp.md`
