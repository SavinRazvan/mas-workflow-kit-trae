# Commit trailer format

## Required (git commits)

- Every commit message body **must** include these two lines **in this order**, with **no other lines between them**:
  - `Author: <Your Full Name>`
  - `GitHub-User: @<yourhandle>`
- Values **must** match `.local/user_settings/github.collaboration.yaml` (`owner.display_name`, `owner.github_user`).

## Optional provenance (after the required pair)

- `Assisted-by: <tool>[:<model>]` — repeat on separate lines when AI **materially** shaped code, tests, docs, or migration logic. Skip for trivial autocomplete, formatting-only, or mechanical boilerplate.
- **Render from config:** `python -m trae_workflow contributors commit-trailers` reads **`.local/user_settings/github.collaboration.yaml`** (copied at install).
- **Do not use `Made-with:`** — human accountability is already expressed by **`Author:`** / **`GitHub-User:`**; an extra editor/tool line is redundant with that contract.
- `Co-authored-by:` — optional; only for real human co-authors (Git convention).

## Responsibility

- The human author remains responsible for reviewing and validating the change.
- **Do not** use AI or scripts to insert human certification, approval, or DCO-style assertions the person did not explicitly intend.

## Order

Typical tail (required lines first, then optional):

```text
Author: Your Full Name
GitHub-User: @yourhandle
Assisted-by: <tool>[:<model>]
```
