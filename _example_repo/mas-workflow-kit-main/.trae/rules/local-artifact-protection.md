# Local artifact protection

- Protected: `.coverage` and `.env` (and any project-specific paths documented in `overlays/` or project README).
- Do not delete, reset, or clean protected paths unless the user explicitly confirms in this conversation.
- Before cleanup commands, list targets; if they include protected paths, ask for approval.
- If removed by mistake, say so and restore from project baseline immediately.
